## About
OOZE is a spiritual successor to RedWarn, which was made by myself and the Ultraviolet team. It's a user script that intends to bring a lot of the features of RedWarn to a wider audience, and to make it easier to maintain and develop. It's also a lot more modular, and is designed to be easy to extend and modify. Additionally, it's designed to be easy to use on mobile devices and tablets.  

OOZE is aiming to be as close to MediaWiki as possible. The aim is to make it feel like part of mediawiki
